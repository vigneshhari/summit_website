      <h1 align=center>Rules</h1>    
    
      Rules:
      Dimensions and Fabrications
      • The bot should fit in a box of dimension 30*30*30 (l*b*h) with all the mechanisms fully executing motion. Length and width is measured to extremities of the robot i.e. include any overhanging bodywork, weapon, or protrusions. The external device used to control the bot is not included in the size constraints.
      
      Weight
      • The machine should not exceed 8kg.(Maximum permissible tolerance: 5%)
      
      
      Battery and Power 
      *Participants should bring power supply for energizing the robot
      *Both wireless and wired robots are allowed for participation.
      *All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing a battery fire, failure to do so will cause direct disqualification
      
      
      Mobility
      *All robots must have easily visible and controlled mobility in order to compete. Methods of mobility include: 
      Rolling (wheels, tracks or the whole robot). 
      *Jumping and hopping is not allowed. 
      *Flying (using air foil, helium balloons, etc.) is not allowed.
      
      Weapons Systems
      *If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizers.
      *Robot cannot use cutters,Flammable/non-flammable liquids or gases for attacking.
      *Robot can have flippers, saw, lifting devices, spinning hammers etc. for attacking

      identity card on them.
      • 3 meter or above wire are preferable for the robots.

      • All participants should cooperate with organizers in all respects.
      
      Rounds
      Qualifier Round
      • The robots which qualify in this round will proceed to the next
      round based on the points collected during one on one matches between
      robots. Lots will be drawn to allot opponents to participants.
      Semi final
      • This round will consist of top four robots from the previous round
      • Maximum time for the battle: 5 minutes
      
      Finals
      • This round will consist of top two robots from the previous round
      • Maximum time for the battle: 10 minutes
      
      Judgement will be done on the basis of following:
      1. Immobilising the opponent
      2. Throwing opponent out of the arena
      3. Damage caused to opponent
